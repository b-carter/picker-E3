First half of the term, students work in teams to apply the design process to an open-ended design/planning problem involving civil and environmental engineering aspects.  In the second half, teams design and build a working model researching, in detail, an aspect of the planning/design project.  Each team then presents the model and the results to the class. Regular written and oral presentations. Students also start on their design portfolio. Enrollment limited; preference to Course 1 majors and minors.",
