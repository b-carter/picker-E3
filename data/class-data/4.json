"description":"Intensive introduction to architectural design tools and process, taught through a series of short exercises. The conceptual basis of each exercise is in the interrogation of the geometric principles that lie at the core of each skill. Skills covered range from techniques of hand drafting, to generation of 3-D computer models, physical model-building, sketching, and diagramming. Weekly lectures and pin-ups address the conventions associated with modes of architectural representation and their capacity to convey ideas. Restricted to level one MArch students.",
