migrating picker to E3

TODO:

look to see if SimileAjax functionalities is included in Exhibit 3. They could be: for example, Exhibit.includeJavascriptFiles() is included.

BUGS:
1. event listener goes away after picking classes
2. Safari filter boxes loses styling
3. Mobile picking doesn't work
4. No comments or ratings yet
5. Extra functionality needs to be added
6. Sometimes loading issue occurs when trying to load classes onto calendar
7. Loading initial classes take too much time
8. Using the same/similar colors multiple times
