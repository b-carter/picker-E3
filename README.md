migrating picker to E3

TODO:

look to see if SimileAjax functionalities is included in Exhibit 3. They could be: for example, Exhibit.includeJavascriptFiles() is included.

BUGS:<br>
1. event listener goes away after picking classes<br>
2. Safari filter boxes loses styling <br>
3. Mobile picking doesn't work <br>
4. No comments or ratings yet: Need to implement login before implementing this, put on hold until implemented login <br>
5. Extra functionality needs to be added <br>
6. Sometimes loading issue occurs when trying to load classes onto calendar: FIXED! <br>
7. Loading initial classes take too much time<br>
8. Using the same/similar colors multiple times<br>
9. Add easy login option: currently working on this<br>
10. Would be nice to have all browsers read from same cookie<br>
