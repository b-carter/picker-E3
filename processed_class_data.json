Active learning aerospace modules make use of information technology. Student teams are immersed in a hands-on, lighter-than-air (LTA) vehicle design project where they design, build, and fly radio-controlled LTA vehicles. The connections between theory and practice are realized in the design exercises. Required design reviews precede the LTA race competition. The performance, weight, and principle characteristics of the LTA vehicles are estimated and illustrated using physics, mathematics, and chemistry known to freshmen, the emphasis being on the application of this knowledge to aerospace engineering and design rather than on exposure to new science and mathematics. Includes exercises in written and oral communication and team building.","prereqs":"--","offering":"Currently Offered","semester":["Spring"],"in-charge":"Hoffman, Jeffrey (Class Admin)","year":"2015","master_subject_id":"16.00","fall_instructors":["J.

Moving from single component analysis to pathways and networks, combines didactic lectures with in-depth analysis of current literature. Emphasizes the chemistry and biochemistry of underlying biological processes. Topics include linking genes/SNPs to disease, defining pathways, analysis of pathways <i>in vivo</i>, systems-level analysis, and applications of network biology. First half of term focuses on fundamental biological processes and tools/analyses needed by biological engineers, and the second half elaborates on these fundamentals by covering complex biological processes. Students acquire skills in the fundamentals of grant preparation using an NIH format and make an oral presentation.","prereqs":"Permission of instructor","offering":"Currently Offered","semester":["Spring"],"in-charge":"White, Forest (Class Admin)","year":"2015","master_subject_id":"20.440","fall_instructors":["F.

Special attention given to the development of new technologies or adapting existing technologies in ways that enable new solutions to global health problems, as well as overcoming barriers to translation of medical technologies for use in settings of great need. Addresses classic themes of social inequalities and health disparities, and issues such as patenting and the development and delivery of pharmaceuticals or other biotechnologies in international context.

The small study group format emphasizes the full participation of each student with the facilitator acting as a guide. The regularity of weekly meetings enhances the students' understanding of MIT's academic expectations. After the initial meetings, students are encouraged to take more responsibility and to lead the group in problem-solving sessions, which helps to maximize their own learning. Each study group meets for a minimum of three hours each week.
