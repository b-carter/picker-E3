The small study group format emphasizes the full participation of each student with the facilitator acting as a guide. The regularity of weekly meetings enhances the students' understanding of MIT's academic expectations. After the initial meetings, students are encouraged to take more responsibility and to lead the group in problem-solving sessions, which helps to maximize their own learning. Each study group meets for a minimum of three hours each week.

Subject asks how an ideal of the \"domestic\" arose in the early modern west, and to what extent did it limit the economic position of women; and how has that idea been challenged, and with what success in the post-industrial period. Focuses on western Europe since the Middle Ages and on the United States, but also examines how these issues have played themselves out in non-Western cultures. Graduate students are expected to pursue the subject in greater depth through reading and individual research.","prereqs":"--","offering":"Currently Offered","semester":["Fall"],"in-charge":"null (Class Admin)","year":"2016","master_subject_id":"WGS.680","fall_instructors":["A.
