The small study group format emphasizes the full participation of each student with the facilitator acting as a guide. The regularity of weekly meetings enhances the students' understanding of MIT's academic expectations. After the initial meetings, students are encouraged to take more responsibility and to lead the group in problem-solving sessions, which helps to maximize their own learning. Each study group meets for a minimum of three hours each week.

Feminist research involves rethinking disciplinary assumptions and methodologies, developing new understandings of what counts as knowledge, seeking alternative ways of understanding the origins of problems/issues, formulating new ways of asking questions and redefining the relationship between subjects and objects of study. Focus on methodology, i.e., the theory and analysis of how research should proceed. Special attention to epistemological issues--pre-suppositions about the nature of knowledge. What makes research distinctively feminist lies in the complex connections between epistemologies, methodologies and research methods. Explore how these connections are formed in the traditional disciplines and raise questions about why they are inadequate and/or problematic for feminist inquiry and what, specifically, are the feminist critiques of these intersections.","prereqs":"Must apply to the Graduate Consortium in Women's Studies","offering":"Currently Offered","semester":["Spring"],"in-charge":"null","year":"2014","master_subject_id":"WGS.615","fall_instructors":["Information: Graduate Program in Women's Studies"],"spring_instructors":["Information: Graduate Program in Women's Studies"],"is_variable_units":"N","Instructor":["Information: Graduate Program in Women's Studies"]},{"type":"LectureSession","label":"L01WGS.615","timeAndPlace":"W EVE (5.30-8.30 PM)  56-154","lecture-section-of":"WGS.615"},{"type":"Class","id":"WGS.640","label":"Studies in Women's Life Narratives","shortLabel":"Women's Life Narratives","level":"High Graduate","total-units":12,"units":"3-0-9","course":"WGS","description":"Close examination of women's life narratives.
